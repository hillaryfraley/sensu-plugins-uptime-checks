## Sensu Asset
The Sensu assets packaged from this repository are built against the Sensu Ruby runtime environment. When using these assets as part of a Sensu Go resource (check, mutator or handler), make sure you include the corresponding Sensu Ruby runtime asset in the list of assets needed by the resource. The current ruby-runtime assets can be found [here](https://bonsai.sensu.io/assets/sensu/sensu-ruby-runtime) in the [Bonsai Asset Index](bonsai.sensu.io).
